# What?

## R is a .blue[language] and .blue[environment] for .red[statistical computing] and .red[graphics].

--

Based on S language orginating from 1970's. Developed during 1990's and became public around 2000.

---

## Language and environment

--

Programming language similar to any other but developed paricularly for data analysis

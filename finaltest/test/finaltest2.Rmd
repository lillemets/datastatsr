Type your commands and comments in an R script. For actions type respective commands in R. For questions provide answers as comments. Submit the R script in Moodle once you're finished.

Answer the questions as comprehensively as you can. Use complete sentences. If relevant, explain your understanding in the context of hypothesis testing. 

# Data import and overview

(@) Read data on the *url* below.<!-- You need to use `read.table()` with argument `header = T`.--> (1 pt)  
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cran/agridat/master/data/diggle.cow.txt
  
(@) Store this data as data frame. (1 pt)

The variables are described as follows:

- `animal`, Animal factor, 26 levels
- `iron`, Factor with levels Iron, NoIron
- `infect`, Factor levels Infected, NonInfected
- `weight`, Weight in (rounded to nearest 5) kilograms
- `day`, Days after birth

(@) See the first 10 rows of data. (1 pt)

```{r}
head(cow, 10)
```

(@) See the dimensions and variable names and types. (1 pt)

```{r}
str(cow)
```

(@) How many variables are in the data?  (1 pt)

(@) How many variables are numeric?  (1 pt)

# Data tidying

(@) Remove observations where age of cow is more than 700 days. (2 pts)

```{r}
cow <- cow[!(cow$day > 700), ]
```

(@) Find the number of missing values of weight. (2 pts)

```{r}
table(is.na(cow$weight))
summary(cow$weight)
```

(@) How many missing values of weight are there? (1 pt)

(@) Remove observation(s) where weight is missing. (1 pt)

```{r}
cow <- cow[!is.na(cow$weight), ]
```

(@) Create a new variable `age` that represents the age of a cow in years. You need to use values from variable `day` and divide these by the number of days in a year. (3 pts)

```{r}
cow$age <- cow$day / 365
```

# Descriptive statistics

(@) See how many infected and not infected cows received iron dosing. (2 pt)

```{r}
table(cow$infect, cow$iron)
```

(@) How would you describe the distribution of observations in this last table? (2 pts)

(@) Find the quartile and mean values of weight. (2 pts)

```{r}
summary(cow$weight)
```

(@) How would you interpret the value of median weight? (2 pts)

(@) How would you interpret the value of 1st quartile? (2 pts)

(@) Plot the distribution of all values of weight. (2 pt)

```{r}
hist(cow$weight)
```

(@) See the mean weights for each day. (2 pts) 

```{r}
aggregate(weight ~ day, cow, mean)
```

(@) Find the maximum weight of every cow. (2 pts) 

```{r}
aggregate(weight ~ animal, cow, max)
```

(@) Draw boxplots of weights for iron dosing and infection status. (3 pts)

```{r}
boxplot(weight ~ iron + infect, cow) # 3 pts
boxplot(weight ~ iron, cow) # 1 pt
boxplot(weight ~ infect, cow) # 1 pt
```

# Testing differences in means

(@) Test if there is a difference in mean weight for cows who received iron dosing and cows that didn't. Use only observations from the last day in data set. (3 pts) 

```{r}
t.test(weight ~ iron, cow[cow$day == max(cow$day), ])
```

(@) Is there a difference? Why? (3 pts)

# Correlation

(@) Plot the relationship between weight of cows and day. (1 pt)

```{r}
plot(weight ~ day, cow)
```

(@) Find Spearman correlation coefficient between weight and day for the first cow (*A1*). (3 pt)

```{r}
cor(cow$weight[cow$animal == 'A01'], cow$day[cow$animal == 'A01'], method = 'spearman')
```

(@) What does the value of this coefficient tell about the relationship? (2 pts)

# Regression modelling

We expect weight to be higher for older cows.

## Estimate an OLS regression model

(@) Estimate an OLS regression model where day is independent and weight dependent variable. Store and see the model. (2 pts)

```{r}
wtMod <- lm(weight ~ day, cow)
summary(wtMod)
```

(@) What is the theoretical weight when age is 0 days? (2 pts) 

(@) How many kg weight increases each day on average? (2 pts) 

(@) How much of the variance in weight is explained by the model? (2 pts) 

## See how well the model fits

(@) Plot the relationship between weight and age in days as points and add the regression line of the model. (1 pt)

```{r}
plot(weight ~ day, cow)
abline(wtMod)
```

(@) Deciding by the plot, does the model fit data well? Why? (2 pts)

(@) Plot residuals against fitted values. (1 pt)

```{r}
plot(wtMod, 1)
```

(@) Is the variance of the residuals constant? Why? (2 pts)

(@) Draw QQ-plot of standardized residuals (1 pt)

```{r}
plot(wtMod, 2)
```

(@) Are residuals normally distributed? Why? (2 pts)

## Estimate a multivariate OLS regression model

(@) Estimate another model where you also add iron dosage as an independent variable. Store and see the model. (2 pts)

```{r}
wtMod2 <- lm(weight ~ day + iron, cow)
summary(wtMod2)
```

(@) How do you interpret the intercept now? (2 pts)

(@) How do you interpret the coefficient for `ironNoIron`? (2 pts)

(@) Test if the two models you estimated are different. (1 pt)

```{r}
anova(wtMod, wtMod2)
```

(@) Is the second model different from first? How?  (3 pts)

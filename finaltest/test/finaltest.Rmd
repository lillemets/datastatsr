Type your commands and comments in an R script. For actions type respective commands in R. For questions provide answers as comments. Submit the R script in Moodle once you're finished.

Answer the questions as comprehensively as you can. Use complete sentences. If relevant, explain your understanding in the context of hypothesis testing. 

# Data import and overview

(@) Read data on the *url* below. (1 pt)  
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lillemets/datastatsr/master/data/verbyla_lupin.csv
  
(@) Store this data as data frame. (1 pt)

The variables are described as follows:

- `gen`, genotype, 9 varieties
- `serp`, factor of 4 levels for serpentine seeding effect
- `site`, site, 11 levels
- `year`, year, 1991-1992
- `loc`, location
- `row`, row
- `col`, colum
- `rep`, rep, 2-3 levels
- `rate`, seeding rate in plants/m^2
- `harvest`, yield in tons/hectare

**Edit on 30.09.19: Variable `harvest` is actually `yield`. For excercises below, it was necessary to type `yield` instead of `harvest`.**

The following tasks involve comparing harvest by location and replication, and investingating relationship between harvest and seeding rate.

(@) See the first rows of data. (1 pt)

```{r}
head(lupin)
```

(@) See the dimensions and variable names and types. (1 pt)

```{r}
str(lupin)
```

(@) See the summary of all variables. (1 pt)

```{r}
summary(lupin)
```

(@) How many observations are in the data?  (1 pt)

(@) How many variables are of type Factor?  (1 pt)

(@) How many missing values are there in variable `harvest`?  (1 pt)

# Data tidying

(@) Remove observations where the value for `loc` is *MtBarker*. (2 pts) <!--  1 for right idea, 2 if works -->

```{r}
lupin <- lupin[lupin$loc != 'MtBarker', ]
```

(@) See how many missing values are there in `harvest` now. (2 pts) <!--  1 for summary, 2 for table() -->

```{r}
table(is.na(lupin$yield))
```

(@) Remove observations where `harvest` is missing. (2 pts) <!--  1 for right idea, 2 if works -->

```{r}
lupin <- lupin[!is.na(lupin$yield), ]
```

(@) Add a variable called `rep2` that has value *"2nd replication"* when `rep` is *R2* and when it is something else then give it value *"Others"*. (3 pts) <!--  1 for new variable name, 2 for ifelse, 3 if all works -->

```{r}
lupin$rep2 <- ifelse(lupin$rep == 'R2', '2nd replication', 'Others')
```

(@) `harvest` is represented in t/ha. Replace the values of `harvest` so that it would be kg/ha. You need to multiply values of `harvest` by 1000. (2 pts) <!--  1 for new variable name, 2 if works -->

```{r}
lupin$yield <- lupin$yield * 1000
```

# Descriptive statistics

(@) Count the observations of each `loc` in both groups of `rep2`. (1 pt)

```{r}
table(lupin$loc, lupin$rep2)
```

(@) See how many observations are there in every every `site` for each `year`. (1 pt)

```{r}
table(lupin$site, lupin$year)
```

(@) How would you describe the distribution of observations in this last table? (1 pts)

(@) Find the mean, median, minimum and maximum values of `harvest`. (2 pts) <!--  1 for right idea, 2 if all are found -->

```{r}
summary(lupin$yield)
```

(@) How would you interpret the value of median harvest? (2 pts)

(@) Plot the distribution of `harvest`. (1 pt)

```{r}
hist(lupin$yield)
```

(@) Get mean values of `harvest` by `rep2`. (2 pts) <!--  1 for right idea, 2 if all are found -->

```{r}
aggregate(yield ~ rep2, lupin, mean)
```

(@) Find mean values of `harvest` for each `loc`. (2 pts) <!--  1 for right idea, 2 if all are found -->

```{r}
aggregate(yield ~ loc, lupin, mean)
```

(@) Draw boxplots of the values of `harvest` of each `loc`. (1 pts)

```{r}
boxplot(yield ~ loc, lupin)
```

# Testing differences in means

(@) Test if mean harvest is different for *2nd replication* and *Others*. (2 pts) <!--  1 for right idea, 2 if correct test -->

```{r}
t.test(yield ~ rep2, lupin)
```

(@) Is there a difference? Why? (3 pts) <!-- 1 for conclusion, 2 for reason, 3 for all -->

(@) Test if mean harvest differs by `loc`.  (2 pts) <!-- 1 for right idea, 2 if correct test -->

```{r}
summary(aov(yield ~ loc, lupin))
```

(@) Is any of the locations in `loc` different from others in mean harvest? Why? (3 pts) <!-- 1 for right idea, 2 if correct test, 3 for all -->

# Correlation

(@) Plot the relationship between `harvest` and `rate` as boxes. (1 pt)

```{r}

```

(@) Find Pearson's correlation coefficient between `harvest` and `rate`. (1 pt)

```{r}
cor(lupin$yield, lupin$rate, use = 'complete.obs', method = 'pearson')
```

(@) How would you describe this relationship by the plot and correlation coefficient? (2 pts) <!-- 1 for positive, 2 for linear or monotonic -->

# Regression modelling

We expect `harvest` to be higher when more seeds are sown (`rate`).

## Estimate an OLS regression model

(@) Estimate an OLS regression model where `harvest` depends on `rate`. Store and see the model. (2 pts)

```{r}
ylMod <- lm(yield ~ rate, lupin)
summary(ylMod)

(@) What is the theoretical harvest when rate is 0? (2 pts) <!-- 2 if all correct -->

(@) How many kg/ha harvest increases when seeding rate increases by 1 plant/m^2? (2 pts) <!-- 2 if all correct -->

(@) How much of the variance in harvest is explained by the model? (2 pts) <!-- 2 if all correct -->

## See how well the model fits

(@) Plot the relationship between `harvest` and `rate` as points and add the regression line of the model. (1 pt)

```{r}
plot(yield ~ rate, lupin)
abline(ylMod)

# Association

Association, relationship, correlation, causation.

We look only some more common measures between two categorical variables and between two continuous variables.

Relationship can be described by:

- magnitude
- direction
- significance

Data in the following examples: counts of webworms in a beet field, with insecticide treatments.

See `?beall.webworms"` for details.

```{r}
webw <- agridat::beall.webworms
head(webw, 3)
```

---

class: center middle inverse

# Contingency tables in R

---

```{r}
head(webw, 3)
table(webw$spray, webw$lead)
```

---

Add names for dimensions with `dnn = `.

``` {r}
table(webw$spray, webw$lead, dnn = c('Spray', 'Lead'))
```

---

You can add more dimensions.

``` {r}
table(webw$spray, webw$lead, webw$trt, dnn = c('Spray', 'Lead', 'Treatment'))
```

---

You can also get perctentages instead of counts with `prop.table(table())`. Change margins that sum to 1 with `margin = ` (`1` for row margins, `2` for column margins).

``` {r}
prop.table(table(webw$trt, webw$y > 1), margin = 1)
```

# Categorical variables

# An example problem

```{r}
webw$spray <- webw$spray == 'Y'
webw$worms <- webw$y > 1
conTab <- table(webw$spray, webw$worms, dnn = c('Sprayed', 'Webworms present'))
conTab
```

## **Did spray treatment help reduce the presence of webworms?**

---

# Odds

Odds of something happening vs not happening.

$$Odds = \frac{Event\space{}happens}{Event\space{}does\space{}not\space{}happen}$$

---

```{r, echo = F}
conTab
```

Odds of webworms present when spraying

```{r}
sum(webw$worms[webw$spray]) # Had worms when sprayed
sum(!webw$worms[webw$spray]) # Didn't have worms when sprayed
sum(webw$worms[webw$spray]) / sum(!webw$worms[webw$spray])
```

---

```{r, echo = F}
conTab
```

Odds of webworms present when not spraying

```{r}
sum(webw$worms[!webw$spray]) # Had worms when didn't spray
sum(!webw$worms[!webw$spray]) # Didn't have worms when didn't spray
sum(webw$worms[!webw$spray]) / sum(!webw$worms[!webw$spray])
```

---

# Odds ratio

Odds of something happening vs not happening with treatment vs without it.

$$Odds\space{}ratio = \frac{Odds\space{}of\space{}event\space{}happening\space{}with\space{}treatment}{Odds\space{}of\space{}event\space{}happening\space{}without\space{}treatment}$$

```{r}
(sum(webw$worms[webw$spray]) / sum(!webw$worms[webw$spray])) / 
  (sum(webw$worms[!webw$spray]) / sum(!webw$worms[!webw$spray]))
```

---

# Risk

Probability of an event happening.

$$Risk = \frac{Event\space{}happens}{Event\space{}happens + event\space{}does\space{}not\space{}happen}$$

---

```{r, echo = F}
conTab
```

Risk of webworms present when sprayed

```{r}
sum(webw$worms[webw$spray]) # Had worms when sprayed
sum(webw$spray) # Sprayed
sum(webw$worms[webw$spray]) / sum(webw$spray)
```

---

```{r, echo = F}
conTab
```

Risk of webworms present when not sprayed

```{r}
sum(webw$worms[!webw$spray]) # Had worms when didn't spray
sum(!webw$spray) # Did not spray
sum(webw$worms[!webw$spray]) / sum(!webw$spray)
```

---

# Risk ratio

Sometimes referred to as *relative risk*.

$$Relative\space{}risk = \frac{Relative\space{}risk\space{}with\space{}treatment}{Relative\space{}risk\space{}without\space{}treatment}$$

```{r}
(sum(webw$worms[webw$spray]) / sum(webw$spray)) / 
  (sum(webw$worms[!webw$spray]) / sum(!webw$spray))
```

# Continuous variables

# Pearson’s correlation coefficient

Evaluates linear relationship (when x increases by 1, y also increases by 1). Values should be normally distributed.

$$r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2 \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2}$$

---

# Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient

Evaluation is based on the ranking of values. Evaluates a monotonic relationship (when x increases, y also increases).

$$r = 1 - \frac{6\sum d_{i}^{2}}{n(n^{2}-1)},$$

where $d_{i}$ is the difference between the two ranks of each observation and $n$ is the number of observations.

Data in the following examples: Nebraska farm income in 2007 by county.

See `?agridat::nebraska.farmincome` for details.

```{r}
farmin <- agridat::nebraska.farmincome
head(farmin, 3)
```

---

Is income from crops related to income from livestock and poultry?

```{r}
par(pty = 's') # Force the plot area to be square
plot(farmin$crop, farmin$animal)
```

---

To get a coefficient of correlation, use function `cor()`. If data has missing values, add `use = 'pairwise.complete.obs'` as an argument to only use observations where both values are not missing. 

```{r}
cor(farmin$crop, farmin$animal, use = 'pairwise.complete.obs')
```

--

By default `cor()` computes Pearson's correlation coefficient. Use `method = 'spearman'` to calculate Spearman's version.

```{r}
cor(farmin$crop, farmin$animal, use = 'pairwise.complete.obs', method = 'spearman')
```

---

When you pass multiple data frame columns to the function, `cor()` returns a correlation table. 

```{r}
corTab <- cor(farmin[, c('animal', 'crop', 'area')], use = 'pairwise.complete.obs')
corTab
```

---

You can get a visual overview of correlations when you pass a correlation table to `heatmap()` function.

```{r, fig.height = 5}
heatmap(corTab)
```

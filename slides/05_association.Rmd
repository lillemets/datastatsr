# Frequency tables

Frequency tables represent absolute (count) or relative (percentage) frequencies by groups.

In R generate with `table()` function.

``` {r, echo = F}
args(table)
```

---
  
```{r}
head(milktr) # Switchback trial of milk yield for two feed mixtures in cattle
```

---
  
`table()` returns counts by a single or multiple categorical variable.

```{r}
table(milktr$group)
```

--
  
```{r}
table(milktr$group, milktr$trt)
```

---
  
```{r}
table(milktr$group, milktr$trt, milktr$period)
```

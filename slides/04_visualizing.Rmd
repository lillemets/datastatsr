# Visualizing data

Graph, chart, **plot**.

A way of describing data.

Part of exploratory data analysis.

---

Data in the following examples: yield for two varieties of barley grown at 51 locations in the years 1901 to 1906.

See `?agridat::student.barley` for details.

```{r}
barley <- agridat::student.barley
head(barley)
```

# Types of plots

---

# Histogram

Displays the frequency of values by bins.

.pull-left[
Use `hist()` to create.
```{r}
hist(barley$income)
```
]

.pull-right[
Use `breaks = n` to set the number of breaks to `n`.
```{r}
hist(barley$income, breaks = 30)
```
]

---

You can also plot probability densities by `freq = F` and adding density estimate line with `lines(density())`.

```{r}
hist(barley$yield, freq = F)
lines(density(barley$yield))
```

---

# Scatterplot

Plot one continuous variable against another.

You can either pass both arguments to the function or use formula mehtod.

.pull-left[
```{r}
plot(barley$yield, barley$income)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
plot(income ~ yield, barley)
```
]

---

Add lines with `abline()`.

```{r}
plot(yield ~ income, barley)
abline(h = median(barley$yield), v = median(barley$income))
```

---

# Barplot

Barplot requires you to specify values, so first we need to get aggregates.

.pull-left[
```{r}
aggr <- aggregate(income ~ farmer, barley, mean)
head(aggr)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
barplot(aggr$income, names.arg = aggr$farmer)
```
]

---

Order with `order()`, flip the axes with `horiz = T` and rotate labels with `las = 2`.

```{r}
aggr <- aggr[order(aggr$income), ]
barplot(aggr$income, names.arg = aggr$farmer, horiz = T, las = 2)
```

---

# Dotchart

---

# Boxplot

Boxplot presents mean value as well as quartiles. All values are between *whiskers* and half of the values are inside the *box* (i.e. the interquartile range).

.pull-left[
```{r}
summary(barley$income)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
boxplot(barley$income)
```
]

---

Boxplots are very useful for comparing values between one or more groups.

```{r}
boxplot(income ~ year, barley)
```

---

class: center middle inverse

# Plot parameters

---

You can list all plot parameters with `?par`. 

Use `par(mfrow = c(1,2))` to draw two plots in a single row.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(barley$yield)
hist(barley$income)
```

---

# Labels

```{r, fig.height = 4}
plot(income ~ yield, barley, 
     main = "Relationship between yield and income", 
     sub = "Source: Student. 1923. On Testing Varieties of Cereals. Biometrika, 15, 271–293.", 
     xlab = "Yield, 'stones' per acre (1 stone = 14 pounds)", 
     ylab = "Income per acre in shillings")
```

# Some principles of creating plots

???
Source: https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/graphs2018.pdf

---

# Only create a plot when needed

Most people understand common fractions without a plot.

```{r}
barplot(c(32,33,34), names.arg = c("32%", "33%", "34%")) # Useless plot
```

---

```{r}
pie(c(10,90), labels = c("10%", "90%")) # Another useless plot
```


---

# Avoid pies

Becouse they make comparisons are difficult.

```{r}
pie(table(barley$farmer))
```

---

Pie plots may work if there are few categories with very different proportions.

```{r}
pie(table(barley$district))
```

---

# Show data points

```{r}
boxplot(yield ~ district, barley)
```

---

```{r}
boxplot(yield ~ district, barley)
points(yield ~ district, barley)
```

---

# Use color

```{r}
boxplot(yield ~ district + gen, barley, col = rainbow(4))
```

---

R recognizes most common colors. Use `colors()` to see all colors that you can pass to `color = `.

```{r}
hist(barley$yield, 30, freq = F, col = 'snow2')
lines(density(barley$yield), col = 'firebrick')
```

---

# Show comparisons

Arrange elements to be compared side by side.

What do we wish to compare? `district` or `gen`?

---

```{r}
par(mfrow = 1:2)
boxplot(yield ~ district + gen, barley, col = rep(rainbow(2), each = 4))
boxplot(yield ~ gen + district, barley, col = rainbow(2))
legend('topright', legend = unique(barley$gen), fill = rainbow(2))
```

---

# Consider the number of dimensions

Use two dimensions for a two-dimensional representation.

--

Don't do this:

![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hLMIU.png)

---

Instead you could create multiple plots.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,4))
replicate(4, barplot(abs(rnorm(4,3,2)), col = rainbow(4)))
```

---

# Flip if too many categories

```{r, fig.height = 4}
par(mfrow = 1:2)
boxplot(yield ~ gen + district, barley, col = rainbow(2))
par(mar = c(0,10,0,0))
boxplot(yield ~ gen + district, barley, col = rainbow(2), horizontal = T, las = 2, ylab = "")
```

---

# Sort by values

```{r, fig.height = 4}
par(mfrow = 1:2)
aggr <- aggregate(income ~ place, barley, mean)
dotchart(aggr[, 2], labels = aggr$place)
aggr <- aggr[order(aggr$income), ]
dotchart(aggr[, 2], labels = aggr$place)
```

---

# Group values

Arrange.

```{r, fig.height = 4}
par(mfrow = 1:2)
aggr <- aggregate(income ~ place, barley, mean)
dotchart(aggr[, 2], labels = aggr$place)
aggr <- aggregate(income ~ place + district, barley, mean)
aggr <- aggr[order(aggr$income), ]
dotchart(aggr[, 3], labels = aggr$place, groups = aggr$district)
```

---

Or use colors.

```{r}
plot(barley$income, barley$yield, col = rainbow(6)[factor(barley$year)])
legend('topright', legend = unique(barley$year), fill = rainbow(6))
```

---

# Use a common scale

Different scales make comparisons difficult.

```{r, fig.height = 4}
par(mfrow = c(1,4))
for (i in unique(barley$district)) {
  plot(yield ~ income, barley[barley$district == i, ], main = i)
}
```

---

It's much easier to compare when all *facets* have the same scale.

```{r, fig.height = 4}
par(mfrow = c(1,4))
for (i in unique(barley$district)) {
  plot(yield ~ income, barley[barley$district == i, ], 
       main = i, 
       ylim = range(barley$income))
}
```

---

# Consider adding zero to scales

Starting from an arbitrary point may distort reality.

```{r, fig.height = 4}
par(mfrow = 1:2)
aggr <- aggregate(income ~ year, barley, mean)
aggr <- aggr[order(aggr$year), ]
plot(income ~ year, aggr, type = 'l')
plot(income ~ year, aggr, type = 'l', ylim = c(0, max(aggr$income)))
```

---

# Use logs when the distribution is skewed

```{r}
par(mfrow = 1:2)
incomes <- rlnorm(1e3, 10, 1)
hist(incomes)
hist(log(incomes))
```

# Make graphs great again: ggplot2

```{r}
#install.packages('ggplot2')
library('ggplot2')
```

Why better than base R graphics?

- Consistent syntax
- Intuitive
- Flexible and powerful
- Many theming options

A plot is created incrementally from *building blocks*:

- data
- aesthetic mapping
- coordinate system
- geometric object
- statistical transformations
- scales
- position adjustments
- faceting

# An example of a ggplot2 plot

```{r}
plotYiInc <- 
ggplot(barley) + aes() + 
  labs(title = "Relationship between yield and income", 
       subtitle = "There is a linear relationship between yield and income. One unit increase in yield increases income by approximately one unit.", 
       caption = "Source: Student. 1923. On Testing Varieties of Cereals. Biometrika, 15, 271–293.", 
       color = "District") + 
  geom_point(aes(x = yield, y = income, color = district), alpha = .8) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x = yield, y = income), size = .5, color = 'gray75', alpha = .2) +

  scale_y_continuous(name = "Income per acre in shillings") +

# Chi-squared test


Chi-squared test statistic:

$$\chi^2 = \sum_{i = 1} \frac{n_{obs, i} - n_{expected, i}}{n_{expected, i}}$$

Basically, sum of all differences between observed and expected values.

```{r}
conTab
chisq.test(conTab)
```

P-value of `r chisq.test(conTab)$p.value` is below treshold of 0.05, so there's a statistically significant relationship.

---

``` {r, fig.height = 5}
curve(dchisq(x, df = chisq.test(conTab)$parameter), from = 0, to = 100)
abline(v = qchisq(.95, df = chisq.test(conTab)$parameter), col = 'red') # Critical value
abline(v = chisq.test(conTab)$statistic, col = 'blue') # Our value
```

It's very unlikely to get a test statistic with value `r chisq.test(conTab)$statistic` or greater if there was no relationship.

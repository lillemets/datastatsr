# Some words about R

---

# What?

## R is a .blue[language] and .blue[environment] for .red[statistical computing] and .red[graphics].

--

Based on S language orginating from 1970's. Developed during 1990's and became public around 2000.

---

## Language and environment

--

Programming language similar to any other but developed paricularly for data analysis

--

Flexible and extensible environment as opposed to many statistical packages

--

Command line interface

---

## Statistical computing and graphics

Includes many statistical procedures for various fields

--

Constantly extended by the community with novel methods

--

Abundant possibilities for plotting data

---

# Why? 

.width-60[![http://r4stats.com/2016/06/08/r-passes-sas-in-scholarly-use-finally/](../img/ruse.png)]

---

# Why?

Free and open source as opposed to most statistical packages

--

Powerful

--

Allows for reproducibile analysis

--

Extensible

--

Active community

---

# How? 

Command line interface

--

.width-50[![](../img/rconsole.png)]

---

# Why not?

--

A steep learining curve

--

Inconsistencies

--

Limited use of hardware

---

# How?

Apply functions on objects

--

Data is not constantly visible

--

No undo

--

Multiple ways to get the same result

# Some dichotomies in statistics

---

# Descriptive vs inferential statistics

.pull-left[Descriptive

- Population
- Simple measures, e.g. mean
- Describing
]


.pull-right[Inferential

- Sample
- Point estimates and intervals
- Drawing inferences and generalizing
]

---

# Frequentist vs bayesian approach


.pull-left[Frequentist

- Traditional
- What's the probability of data given some estimate?
- Prior information is not relevant
- Single parametric inference
]


.pull-right[Bayesian

- Modern application
- What's the probability of an estimate?
- Construction of a prior
- Multiplication of an inference to get a posterior estimate
]

We will focus on the Frequentist approach.

# Statistics vs data *science*, machine learning, aritficial intelligence ...

.pull-left[Statistics

- Less data
- Clean datasets
- Traditonal methods
- Mathematics and calculations
- Aim is to explain
]


.pull-left[Data *science*

- Big data
- Data in various formats and untidy
- New methods
- Programming approach
- Aim is to predict
